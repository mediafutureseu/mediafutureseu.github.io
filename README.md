# Frontend of the infrastructure for experimental support

The aim of this repository is to show the work done in Mediafutures to support the partners and participants in the open calls and innovation experiments with knowledge and experience in both technical and socio-technical aspects in order to enable them to deliver high-quality processes and projects throughout the programme. Thus our work will
1. develop a data innovation toolkit providing guidance and resources to develop innovation activities; and
2. provide experiment support in the form of access to data, technology and expertise in areas pertinent to the project, including machine learning, human-centric AI, multimedia processing, data-driven journalism, media studies, legal and ethical aspects of data-driven innovation etc. 

Drawing on extensive know-how both from a research perspective as well as experience in running successful accelerators (DataPitch, ODINE) we will further support innovation experiments and provide training and mentoring for successful applicants. Ultimately, this respository will wrap all learnings generated in the course of the programme into a data and innovation toolkit, which will ensure that these learnings remain accessible beyond the lifetime of the project.
